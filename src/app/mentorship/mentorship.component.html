            <h4>WHY HIRE MENTOR?</h4>
            <H4>HERE ARE REASONS WHY YOU NEED A MENTOR</H4>
            <ol>
                <li><h4>Personalised guidance from an expert</h4>
                    <p>A mentor has gained professional experience and practical
                         skills throughout their career, and they can share that knowledge with you. 
                         They can advise you in areas like time management, interpersonal skills and business 
                         relationships. Consider asking your mentor to share important lessons from critical 
                         decision points in their career or things they wish they had known before significant milestones. 
                         They can share personalised 
                        stories and help guide you on your career path.

                <li><h4>Accelerated professional development</h4>
                    <p>Over time, your mentor may have learned how long key career steps take to achieve. 
                        They can assist you while reaching
                         similar milestones and provide guidance to help you minimise potential challenges.
                          Your mentor can also monitor your professional development. 
                          Consider asking them to help you set regular goals and schedule check-ins to ensure you're making good progress.
                          Your mentor may also be familiar with important industry changes and can suggest 
                          the best training courses to take or exciting new development areas to focus on. 
                          Consider asking them for advice to help you accelerate your professional growth.

                </li>
                 <li><h4>More focused goals</h4>
                <p> Since they're successful in your work field, your mentor may know what both the industry, 
                    and your company specifically, are looking for. By working with a mentor, you can get help 
                    setting short-term practical goals and long-term career goals. You can also try to match these goals 
                    with your employer's needs. 
                    You can rely on your mentor to help you set and achieve specific goals for your role and company.

                <li><h4>Increased motivation</h4>
                <p>A mentor can help motivate and inspire you. By using your mentor as an example, 
                    you can remind yourself what you're working towards. 
                    Your mentor's personal support can give you more confidence and a willingness to try new things.
                     Consider sharing your successes with your mentor so you can celebrate them together.
